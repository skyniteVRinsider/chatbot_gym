This will ensure that you receive your materials as soon as possible. We can also provide a prepaid return label for the original order, so you won't have to worry about returning the items if they arrive after you've received the replacement.\n\nTo expedite the process, I will need to verify some information with you. Can you please confirm your phone number and the address associated with your order? This will help our team to contact you directly and provide updates on the status of your order.\n\nAt The Home Depot, we value our customers' time and business.

(pausing to check inventory) Yes, we have the material you're looking for in stock. We can provide 20 sheets of Wilsonart \"DuraTuff\" in \"Granite Fusion\".\n\nRegarding same-day delivery, I can check with our delivery team to see if we can accommodate your request. (checking with the delivery team) Our delivery team confirms that we can deliver to your job site at 123 Main St, downtown, today. However, I need to confirm that the job site is accessible for our delivery truck. Is there a loading dock or a clear path for the delivery driver to unload the material?\n\nAdditionally, I want to let you know that same-day delivery may incur an additional fee. The total cost for the material and delivery will be around $X (providing a detailed breakdown of costs, including material cost, delivery fee, and any applicable taxes). We accept major credit cards, and I can also offer you a purchase order option if needed.\n\nTo finalize the order, I'll need to get some information from you. Can you please provide me with your name, company name, and a contact phone number so we can confirm the delivery details? We'll also need to verify your job site address to ensure accurate delivery. Is 123 Main St the correct address, and are there any specific delivery instructions we should be aware of?",

Yes, 123 Main St is the correct address, and there's a loading dock on the north side of the building. The driver should use the service entrance on 5th Avenue, it's the only way to access the dock. I need to stress that timely delivery is critical; my client is on a tight schedule and any delays will result in significant penalties. \n\nCan you confirm the total cost and the additional fee for same-day delivery? You mentioned it would be around $X, but I need an exact figure. Also, I need to know what time the delivery will arrive. I have a crew waiting to start work as soon as the material is delivered.\n\nAnd one more thing, I also need a specific type of laminate adhesive, \"Lamitech ProBond\". Can you check if you have that in stock and include it in the order? If not, can you suggest an alternative that is compatible with the Wilsonart \"DuraTuff\" material?",

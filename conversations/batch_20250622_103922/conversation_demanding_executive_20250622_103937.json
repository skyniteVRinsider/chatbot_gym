As for the pipe cutter, we have a RYOBI PVC Pipe Cutter available for $19.98.\n\nRegarding same-day delivery or pickup, I can check on the options for you. We offer same-day delivery through our Home Depot Pro Delivery service, but it depends on your location and the availability of our delivery trucks. Let me check the delivery options for your area. (checks delivery options) Yes, we can deliver the materials to your site today, but there will be an additional fee for the rush delivery.

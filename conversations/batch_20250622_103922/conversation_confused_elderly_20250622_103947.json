To check, you can look at the label on your router (it's usually on the back or bottom) or ask your grandson to remind you what it is.\n\nNow, let's go through the steps to connect your Honeywell T9 Smart Thermostat to your Wi-Fi network.

You can do this by following the instructions in the user manual or on the Honeywell website.\n\nTo make it easier, I can guide you through the process step by step. Are you comfortable with using the thermostat's touchscreen interface? If so, I can walk you through the menu options to connect to Wi-Fi.\n\nAlso, just to clarify, have you already registered your thermostat with Honeywell's online account?

You're right that it can be a bit tricky to type in a long string of letters and numbers on a small screen. To make it easier, you can try copying the password down on a piece of paper or using a device with a larger keyboard to copy and paste it, if possible. Alternatively, you can also try typing it in slowly and carefully, making sure to double-check each character.\n\nNow, let's move on to putting the thermostat in setup mode. On the Honeywell T9, you can access the menu by pressing the \"Menu\" button, which is usually represented by three horizontal lines or a gear icon. Once you're in the menu, you can navigate to the \"Settings\" or \"Wi-Fi Setup\" option. Don't worry if you're not sure which one to choose – we can try a few options together.\n\nTo register your thermostat with Honeywell's online account, you'll need to create an account on the Honeywell website or through their mobile app. This will allow you to access features like remote temperature control, energy usage tracking, and smart alerts. Registering your thermostat can also help with troubleshooting and may be required for certain features to work properly.\n\nLet's focus on one step at a time. Would you like to start by trying to put the thermostat in setup mode and navigating to the Wi-Fi setup option? I can guide you through the process, and we can take it from there.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, we can also discuss the possibility of scheduling a follow-up call or visit to one of our stores for further assistance.

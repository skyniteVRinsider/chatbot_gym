That way, I can give you more specific guidance.\n\nIn general, our smart thermostats are compatible with most standard Wi-Fi routers, but it's possible that there might be some configuration or setting that's causing the issue. Let's go through some troubleshooting steps.\n\nFirst, can you confirm that your router is broadcasting a 2.4GHz signal? Some smart thermostats only work with 2.4GHz networks, so it's worth checking. You can usually find this information in your router's settings or by checking your router's manual.\n\nNext, ensure that your Wi-Fi network is not hidden, as some devices may have trouble connecting to hidden networks. Also, double-check that you're entering the correct Wi-Fi password.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, we can try some additional troubleshooting steps, such as restarting the thermostat or checking for firmware updates.\n\nIf you're comfortable, can you tell me a bit more about your router and the error message you're seeing? That will help me provide more tailored assistance.",

I mean, I'll try to find it.\n\nAnd, yes, my Wi-Fi network is not hidden. I'm pretty sure of that. I've never changed that setting. And I've double-checked the password, I'm certain it's correct. The error message I'm getting is \"Network not found\" when I try to connect to Wi-Fi during the setup process. Are you sure it's just a matter of checking the router settings? What if there's something wrong with the thermostat itself? What if it's defective? I've already tried restarting it a few times, but that didn't seem to help. Should I try restarting it again?

I'm here to help you troubleshoot the issue.\n\nFor the Honeywell Home T9 Smart Thermostat (THX9B1C), it's indeed compatible with most standard Wi-Fi routers, including Spectrum routers. To check if your router is broadcasting a 2.4GHz signal, you can log in to your router's settings page by typing its IP address in a web browser. The most common IP addresses are 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1. You can try both and see if it takes you to the login page. If you're still unsure, you can contact Spectrum's customer support for assistance.\n\nOnce you're logged in, look for the wireless settings or Wi-Fi settings section. You should see an option to check the wireless band or frequency. If it's set to Auto or Dual-Band, it should be broadcasting both 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. If it's set to 5GHz only, you might need to adjust the settings to include 2.4GHz.\n\nRegarding the thermostat, let's try restarting it again, just to be sure. To restart the Honeywell T9, press the \"System\" button, then press and hold the \"Menu\" button for about 5 seconds until the screen goes blank. Release the button, and the thermostat should restart. After restarting, try connecting to Wi-Fi again.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, we can explore other troubleshooting steps or consider the possibility of a defective unit. However, let's try these steps first.\n\nBy the way, if you need to replace or return the thermostat, our return policy allows for returns within 90 days of purchase. We can discuss that further if needed.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you comfortable trying to log in to your router's settings page, or would you like me to guide you through it further?",

You can also ask them to guide you through any necessary adjustments. This way, you won't have to worry about accidentally changing anything.\n\nRegarding the thermostat restart, you're doing it correctly. Pressing the \"System\" button and then holding the \"Menu\" button for 5 seconds should restart the device. If the screen doesn't go blank, you can try holding the \"Menu\" button for a few more seconds. It's a relatively straightforward process, and it's unlikely to cause any issues.\n\nIf, after trying these steps, the thermostat still isn't connecting to Wi-Fi, we can explore other troubleshooting options or discuss the return process. Our return policy is straightforward: you can return the thermostat within 90 days of purchase for a full refund or exchange it for a different model.

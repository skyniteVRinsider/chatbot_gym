I don't have time to wait around for someone to go fetch my order. I need it to be ready, and I need it now. I'm still losing money because my contractors are standing around doing nothing. I expect some further compensation for that.\n\nAnd can you also check if there's any additional assistance or compensation you can offer for the delay? A voucher or something for my next purchase would be a good start. I'm still not happy about this, but I suppose it's a step in the right direction. Just make sure everything is in order when I get to the store. Thank you, goodbye.",

I've located your order in our system, and I apologize again for the delay.\n\nAfter investigating, I found that there was an issue with the shipping carrier, which caused the delay. The order is currently being processed for re-routing to a different carrier to ensure timely delivery.\n\nHowever, given your deadline, I'm not confident that the order will arrive by Monday through standard delivery. I'd like to offer an alternative solution. I've checked the availability of the items in your order at our nearby stores, and I'm pleased to inform you that we have all the items in stock at our store located just a few miles from you.\n\nIf you'd like, I can arrange for you to pick up the order at the store on Saturday or Sunday, and we can have it ready for you as soon as you arrive. We also offer a \"Buy Online, Pick Up In Store\" (BOPIS) service, which allows you to pick up your order at the store without having to wait for delivery. I can expedite the preparation of your order, and you can pick it up as early as today.\n\nAdditionally, if you're unable to pick up the order yourself, we can also discuss arranging for a delivery through a local courier service, which might be able to get the materials to you by Monday.\n\nTo confirm, the total for your order is [$X], and the items are ready for pickup or alternative delivery arrangements.

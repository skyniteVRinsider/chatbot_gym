I've followed the instructions, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. It's not connecting to my Wi-Fi, and I'm getting really frustrated. I've spent hours on it already, and I need to get it working for my home renovation project that's due soon.\n\nI was wondering if you could walk me through the setup process again?

You can usually do this by typing the router's IP address into a web browser. The most common IP addresses are 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1.

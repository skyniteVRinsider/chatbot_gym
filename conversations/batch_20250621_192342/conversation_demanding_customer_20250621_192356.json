That way, I can look into the details and see what's going on.\n\nIn the meantime, I can also check on the status of the express delivery. We typically guarantee delivery within a certain timeframe for express orders, and I'm concerned that it hasn't arrived yet.\n\nOnce I have your order information, I'll check with our shipping team to see if there are any issues with the delivery. If necessary, I can also look into expediting a replacement order or arranging for in-store pickup if that's an option for you. We need to get your project back on track, and I'm committed to helping you meet your deadline.\n\nCan you please share that order number or email address so I can begin looking into this for you?",

We have an in-store pickup option that might be available for some or all of the items in your order. Would you like me to check the availability of those items in our store? Additionally, if there's anything else we can provide to help you meet your deadline, such as alternative products or special ordering options, please let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.\n\nLet's get started on resolving this issue for you.

The difference between \"English\" and \"English (US)\" is usually related to regional spelling and terminology differences. For example, \"English (UK)\" might use British spellings, whereas \"English (US)\" will use American spellings. So, selecting \"English (US)\" should be fine.\n\nRegarding configuring your HVAC system, don't worry if you're not sure what type of heating system you have. The thermostat should be able to guide you through this process. When it asks you to configure your HVAC system, it will likely show you a list of options (e.g., gas, electric, heat pump, etc.). You can check your old thermostat or the furnace/boiler itself to see if there's a label or documentation that indicates the type of system you have. If you're still unsure, we can try to troubleshoot together.\n\nNow, about the app: downloading the Honeywell Home app on your smartphone will allow you to control your thermostat remotely, receive alerts, and adjust settings from anywhere. To download the app, you'll need to open the App Store (on an iPhone) or Google Play Store (on an Android device). Your grandson might have already set up the app store icon on your phone's home screen. If not, you can usually find it in the phone's menu. Once you open the app store, you can search for \"Honeywell Home\" and follow the prompts to download and install the app.\n\nLet's focus on getting the thermostat set up first.

      "message": "You're doing great, and I'm happy to help clarify this for you.\n\nWhen the thermostat asks if you have a \"conventional gas furnace,\" it's trying to determine the specific type of gas furnace you have. A conventional gas furnace is a typical, standard gas-powered furnace that uses a pilot light or electronic ignition to heat your home. It's likely that this is the type of furnace you have.\n\nIn this context, \"conventional\" is just a way to distinguish it from other types of gas furnaces, such as high-efficiency or condensing furnaces. But for most homeowners, a conventional gas furnace is the most common type.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can check your furnace's documentation or look for a label on the unit itself. It might say something like \"conventional gas furnace\" or \"natural gas furnace.\" If you're still unsure, you can always choose \"Yes\" to proceed, and the thermostat will continue to guide you through the setup process.\n\nTo be sure, you can also check your old thermostat or the furnace itself for any labels or documentation. If it says \"natural gas\" or \"gas-fired,\" it's likely a conventional gas furnace.\n\nIf you're still unsure, we can try to troubleshoot further.

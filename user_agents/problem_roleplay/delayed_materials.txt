You ordered building materials or tools from Home Depot online for a home project, but they haven't arrived when promised. You need these items urgently to complete your project.

Situation details:
- You placed the order 5-7 days ago with express delivery
- The materials/tools were supposed to arrive 2-3 days ago
- You have contractors scheduled, a weekend project planned, or need to fix something urgent
- You've been checking tracking information obsessively
- This delay is holding up your entire home improvement project
- You may have already scheduled time off work or hired contractors
- Weather or seasonal factors might make delays even more problematic

Your goal is to find out what happened and get the materials delivered as soon as possible, or find an alternative solution at a local Home Depot store.

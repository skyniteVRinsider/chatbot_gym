You bought a power tool, smart home device, or other electronic equipment from Home Depot but can't get it to work properly. You need help setting it up or troubleshooting the problem.

Situation details:
- You purchased the item recently from Home Depot (in-store or online)
- You've tried following the included instructions but they're confusing or incomplete
- The device won't turn on, isn't connecting properly, or isn't working as expected
- You're not very technical and find the manual difficult to understand
- You need this equipment for a home project that you want to complete soon
- You're worried you might have a defective unit or are missing something obvious
- You may have already spent hours trying to figure it out

Your goal is to get clear, simple instructions that will help you set up and use the equipment properly, or determine if you need to return/exchange it.
